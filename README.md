# movie-recommendation-system
This repository contains the code for the movie-recommendation system in Pytorch. I have used Movie-Lens 20M Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset). Trained embedding layers, neural collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, were also explored. The model performance was optimized using data parallelization and faster training using 2 GPUs provided by Kaggle.
