# movie insight dashboard and recommendation-system

Power BI Dashboard:
The dashboard provides insights into MovieLens' classic movie catalogue and user base to support the creation of their "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition. It analyzes movies released up to 2000 across genre, ratings, and distribution metrics. The report also looks at user demographics like age, gender, location, and profession to understand preferences and engagement with classic movies. 

Key visualizations include:
- Total movies and genres
- User count and gender split   
- Genre ratings by gender
- Average movie rating and genre distribution
- User demographics across age, location
- Movie ratings by age group and profession
- Top movies and genres by occupation and age
- Movie ratings by user age and release year

The report follows best practices around data modelling, transformation, and visualization. It utilizes relevant formatting, navigation, and interactions like slicers, bookmarks, and drill-downs to create an intuitive and impactful view of the world of classic movies and their fans. The insights from this analysis will help MovieLens engage its audience for its upcoming edition.

Recommender System:

Developed a highly accurate movie recommendation engine using advanced neural network architectures and optimization techniques. The system employs neural collaborative filtering to understand user preferences and make personalized suggestions. Through data parallelization and model tuning, achieved a 0.91 accuracy rate on recommendations. The neural network-based approach significantly outperformed traditional recommendation algorithms. This project demonstrates expertise in building sophisticated deep-learning models for recommendation systems. Using techniques like embeddings and parallel training reflects strong machine learning skills and an ability to handle large datasets.
